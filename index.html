                        <h2>About</h2>
                        <p>Hi, my name is Heather and I am a second year Computer Science student at the University of California, Santa Barbara. I am highly motivated and determined, and my biggest passion is discovering new hobbies that I enjoy and obsessively working to improve my skills. Whether it be delving into areas of software I've never encountered before (always with Stack Overflow open in another tab), absorbing an overwhelming amount of networking advice, or even finding a new way to bake banana bread, I am always eager to learn! </p>
                        
                        <p>I have experience developing web applications with HTML, CSS, and jQuery, as well as designing object oriented programs/algorithms in C++. Currently, I'm an aspiring software engineer looking for internship opportunities where I can obtain real world experience in the tech industry during the summer of 2021. </p>
                        
                        <p>Aside from academic and professional experiences, I love being involved with computer science education and supporting other women in tech. I am currently the Treasurer for UCSB's chapter of the Society of Women Engineers (encouraging women to explore the engineering industry, as well as outreach to show younger kids how fun engineering can be!), and was previously an Undergraduate Learning Assistant for an intermediate programming course at UCSB (Intro to C++, assisted during lab hours to give students a better understanding of the core principles of data structures and algorithms), and a Code Educator for Robotics and Things (introduced students to web development and helped them build their own exciting website). </p>
